It might not make sense to have container components anymore when it is already so easy to fetch data. The main purposes of a container are to fetch data, possibly adapt it, handle error/loading states and finally to pass on the data to a "dumb" UI component. However, each of these purposes can be done in 1 or a few lines of code, especially when using generated query hooks. It also does not save work, since containers tend to render the same child component tree, so they cannot be reused with different UI components.
One possible use case could be to improve reusability of UI components. In that case, it would make sense to have separation between data fetching and UI rendering. However, this doesn't seem common enough for a "container pattern" to make sense.
