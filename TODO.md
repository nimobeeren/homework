* test babel olyfill (is it needed?) and check other differences with typescript example webpack config
* HMR: with hooks (need React-fire-DOM)
* Production
* Webpack HTML plugin
* Babel/TS on back-end?
* Do I need `@babel/preset-env` for supporting older browsers?
* Move all config files to `/config` dir
* Error boundary, make it pretty like `create-react-app`
* Testing
* GraphQL
* SSR?
