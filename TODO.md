Testing

- Migrate to React Testing Library
- Snapshot testing
- Automatically generate integration tests for each query?
- Automocking

Optimization

- SSR?
- Code splitting

Infrastructure

- Proper logging
- Migrate to a two (three?) package architecture
- Idea: write configuration in TS and throw the whole thing through babel/tsc
- Test if babel is really faster than tsc
