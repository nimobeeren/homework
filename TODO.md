Testing

- Migrate to React Testing Library
- eslint-plugin-testing-library
- Snapshot testing
- Automatically generate integration tests for each query?
- Automocking

Linting

- Prettier/ESLint conflicts (wait for eslint-config-falcon update) -> probably change ESLint config
- Set a max line length

Optimization

- SSR?
- Code splitting

Infrastructure

- Proper logging
- Do we need a babelrc for /graphql and /test-utils?
- Make start-server work without `cd`
- Find a way to simplify long relative imports that works with both Parcel and Jest
- Migrate to a two (three?) package architecture
